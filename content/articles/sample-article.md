# The Real Cost of Cloud AI: Why Inference Margins Collapse at Scale

Cloud AI promises flexibility but delivers unpredictable costs. In this guide, we'll explore why inference costs explode as you scale and how to model your true TCO.

## The Hidden Costs of Cloud AI

When enterprises first adopt cloud AI, the economics seem attractive. Pay-as-you-go pricing, no upfront investment, and instant scalability. But as usage grows, a troubling pattern emerges.

### Why Costs Explode at Scale

1. **GPU Instance Pricing**: Cloud GPU instances cost 3-5x more per hour than equivalent on-premises hardware over a 3-year period.

2. **Data Transfer Fees**: Moving large datasets and model outputs incurs significant egress charges that aren't obvious upfront.

3. **Idle Capacity Waste**: Reserved instances go unused during off-peak hours, but you're still paying.

## Calculating Your True TCO

To understand your real costs, you need to factor in:

- Compute costs (GPU hours × rate)
- Storage costs (model weights, training data, outputs)
- Data transfer costs (ingress + egress)
- Support and management overhead
- Opportunity cost of vendor lock-in

## When Private Infrastructure Makes Sense

Private AI infrastructure typically becomes more cost-effective when:

- Monthly cloud spend exceeds $50,000
- GPU utilization is predictable (>60% of capacity)
- Data residency or compliance requirements exist
- Inference latency requirements are strict (<50ms)
