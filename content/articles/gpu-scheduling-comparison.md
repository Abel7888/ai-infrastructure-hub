## **Case Study: AUAR (Automated Architecture) – Robotic Microfactories in the UK**

### **Overview**

AUAR (Automated Architecture) is a UK-based startup founded by **Mollie Claypool** and **Gilles Retsin** with a vision to revolutionize the construction industry through automation and decentralization. The company has developed **portable robotic microfactories** designed to build affordable, sustainable timber homes directly on-site. By combining **digital design**, **robotics**, and **localized production**, AUAR aims to address the UK’s housing shortage and reduce the environmental impact of construction.





### **Challenge**

The UK faces a severe housing crisis, with a shortage of over **300,000 homes annually**, driven by rising populations, urbanization, and outdated construction practices. Traditional construction methods are labor-intensive, slow, and often inefficient. Even modular construction, though faster, relies on centralized factories that require expensive logistics and limit design adaptability.

Moreover, the construction sector is one of the **largest contributors to carbon emissions**, due to both material usage and energy-intensive manufacturing processes.





### **Solution**

AUAR's solution is built around **robotic microfactories**—compact, mobile production units equipped with robotic arms that can be deployed to different locations, such as unused industrial sites or even community centers. These microfactories automate the cutting and assembly of timber building blocks that can be rapidly assembled into housing units.

#### **Key Components:**

* **Master Builder Software:**
   A proprietary design-to-production platform that translates architectural designs into instructions for robotic arms. It enables **customizable**, **modular**, and **precise** construction with minimal human labor.


* **Timber Block System:**
   AUAR uses a **modular timber block system** that reduces construction complexity and allows for **scalable, reconfigurable architecture**. Timber was chosen for its **sustainability** and **carbon sequestration** properties.


* **Portable Microfactories:**
   Each microfactory houses robotic arms and processing tools within a container-sized unit. They are **easy to transport**, **quick to set up**, and capable of operating in various urban environments.







### **Impact & Achievements**

* **Scalability & Output Potential:**
   AUAR claims that **500 microfactories** operating simultaneously could produce up to **100,000 homes per year**—a massive improvement over centralized modular construction, both in speed and geographic flexibility.


* **Cost Efficiency:**
   By eliminating the need for large-scale logistics and reducing labor, AUAR estimates that its homes can be built at a **fraction of the cost** of conventional construction or traditional modular factories.


* **Environmental Benefits:**
   The use of **renewable timber**, **localized production**, and **robotic precision** minimizes waste and energy consumption. The modularity of the building blocks also allows for easier **disassembly and reuse**.


* **Social Equity and Job Creation:**
   By decentralizing construction, AUAR also fosters **community-led development**. Local microfactories can employ and train residents, generating economic activity while addressing housing needs.


* **Pilot Projects and Partnerships:**
   AUAR has partnered with **local councils**, **housing developers**, and **community organizations** to deploy pilot housing units. Their projects demonstrate not just technical viability, but social and architectural innovation.







### **Founders' Vision**

Co-founders **Mollie Claypool** and **Gilles Retsin** bring academic and architectural expertise to the startup. They view AUAR not merely as a construction tech company, but as a platform to **rethink how architecture is designed, produced, and distributed** in a digital age.

*“Our aim is not just to build homes faster and cheaper—but to enable communities to take ownership of how and where they live.”*
 — Mollie Claypool, Co-founder, AUAR





### **Looking Ahead**

AUAR is currently scaling its technology and expanding its network of microfactories across the UK. Future goals include:

* Broader deployment across Europe and other housing-stressed regions.


* Expanding the capabilities of **Master Builder** to include AI-assisted design.


* Creating a **platform for open-source design templates**, allowing communities and designers to customize structures according to local needs.


* Pioneering **circular economy models** in housing through modular reuse and flexible upgrading.







### **Conclusion**

AUAR’s approach offers a compelling glimpse into the future of construction—**decentralized, automated, and community-focused**. By embedding robotics into micro-scale production and aligning with sustainable materials, AUAR is building not only homes, but a new architecture of equity and innovation. Its model challenges the traditional paradigms of construction and presents a scalable, replicable path toward solving the global housing crisis.
