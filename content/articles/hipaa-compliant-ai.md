# HIPAA-Compliant AI Infrastructure: On-Prem, Hybrid, or Cloud?

Healthcare organizations face unique challenges when deploying AI. This guide helps you navigate HIPAA requirements.

## Understanding HIPAA for AI

HIPAA doesn't prohibit cloud AI, but it does require:

- **Data encryption** at rest and in transit
- **Access controls** and audit logging
- **Business Associate Agreements** with vendors
- **Risk assessments** for new technologies

## Deployment Options

### Cloud AI (AWS, Azure, GCP)

Major cloud providers offer HIPAA-eligible services, but challenges include:

- Data residency concerns
- Unpredictable costs at scale
- Limited control over infrastructure
- BAA complexity

### On-Premises AI

Private infrastructure offers maximum control:

- Complete data sovereignty
- Predictable costs
- Full audit capability
- No external dependencies

### Hybrid Approach

Many healthcare systems adopt hybrid models:

- PHI stays on-premises
- Development and testing in cloud
- Gradual migration as trust builds

## Our Recommendation

For most healthcare organizations, we recommend starting with on-premises AI for PHI workloads, with cloud for development. This satisfies compliance while maintaining flexibility.
